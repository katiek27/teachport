# goomba goomba goomba #
quick review ticket i have whipped up.
> observe the goomba
- added some great great special fx
- saturation changing and the size, and the speed

> collisions
- this.destroy whenever mario touches the sides of the goomba
- and also it will go back to the restart button, but i cannot find the actual screen for it to change to D:
- thats bc i was trying to ask mort but i dont have time aslkjasdlf

> so what have we learned...
- im so so so good at making typos and case sensitive errors
- order matters bc "bla bla it goes from top to bottom"
- im not sure what else to add...
